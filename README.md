# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

# Installation guide

Simply run this command in the terminal: `npm install`

And to spin up the development server: `npm run dev`

And to run the test suite: `npm run test`

# Side note

I used a TDD method to create this little application. Therefore, the test suite was completed prior to any implementation.

I won't offer any explanations about my code since I think excellent code should be self-explanatory and the implementation details should be tested using a descriptive test suite. Instead, I recommend looking at the test suite first to see if the function satisfies the requirements.

At this point, I also understand that TypeScript should be used in my implementation because it will undoubtedly aid in removing invalid input types. But I won't be able to make it in time because of the deadline. If possible, I'll fix it in the following iteration :D
